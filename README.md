Learning materials of the course CIVL7108 at HKU

This course is a postgraduate-level course that introduces the theory of data science and its application in a wide range of civil engineering (in particular transportation engineering) problems. It is taught by Dr. Jintao Ke (kejintao@hku.hk).

The study notes and part of codes contained in the repository are written by Siyi Mao (siyimao@connect.hku.hk). They are beneficial for consolidating my knowledge and serving as a reference for interested learners.
